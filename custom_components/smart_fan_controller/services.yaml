apply_learned_settings:
  name: Apply learned settings
  description: Apply optimal parameters computed from the learning algorithm. The integration automatically learns the best settings for deadband, soft_error, hard_error, and limit_timeout based on observed system behavior. This service applies those learned parameters and reloads the integration.

reset_learning:
  name: Reset learning
  description: Clear all learning data and restart the learning process from scratch. This removes all collected samples and statistics, allowing the integration to begin learning optimal parameters again.
